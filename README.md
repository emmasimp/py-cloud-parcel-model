Simple parcel model that calculates pressure, temperature, RH and the growth of aerosol particles into cloud drops. This version only supports the condensation of water and external mixtures of aerosol and there is no ice phase. 
How to use:
1. edit namelist.py specifying your initial conditions of aerosol, temperature, pressure and RH
2. run main.py
